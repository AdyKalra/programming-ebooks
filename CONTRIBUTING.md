If you have an eBook in PDF format that you'd like to add to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request!

## Guidelines

1. **Categorization**. We're categorizing eBooks by folder. If your eBook fits well into an existing folder, please place it there. If not, feel free to create a new folder that accurately reflects the categorization of your eBook.
2. **Format**. We prefer eBooks that are in PDF format.
3. **Indexing**. Please add a link to your eBook to the README.md's Table of Contents. The `h3` should map to the folder that your eBook is in.
